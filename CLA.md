# Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Energy Leaderboard Runner project ("We" or "The Project"). In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, We must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Project and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

By submitting a Pull Request to this repository, you accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to the Project.

1.  **Definitions.**
    *   "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the Project.
    *   "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Project.

2.  **Grant of Copyright License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

3.  **Grant of Patent License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work.

4.  **Right to Relicense.** You agree that the Project Maintainers have the right to license your Contribution under different license terms (including commercial licenses) in the future, provided that the Contribution also remains available under the terms of the project's open source license (currently GNU GPLv3).

5.  **Representations.** You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the Project, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Project.

6.  **No Warranty.** You provide your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
