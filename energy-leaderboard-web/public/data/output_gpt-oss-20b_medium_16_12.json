    "prompt": "Explain how a rainbow forms in the sky.",
    "completion": "### The Basics: Light, Water, and Geometry\n\nA rainbow is an optical illusion that appears when sunlight interacts with tiny water droplets suspended in the air—usually after a rain shower, when the sun is low in the sky. The phenomenon is a perfect illustration of a few elementary physics principles: **refraction, reflection, dispersion, and geometry**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Path of a Single Light Ray\n\nConsider one tiny spherical water droplet. When a single beam of sunlight strikes it, the light does the following:\n\n| Step | What Happens | Why It Happens |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| **1. Refraction (entry)** | Light bends as it enters the droplet. | The speed of light is slower in water than in air. |\n| **2. Reflection (inside)** | Light reflects off the back surface of the droplet. | The droplet’s curved surface makes the light bounce back, just like a mirror. |\n| **3. Refraction (exit)** | Light bends again as it leaves the droplet. | Light speeds up again as it exits into air. |\n\nBecause the droplet is a sphere, the same geometry applies no matter where the sunlight hits it. The key point is that each color of light (red, orange, … blue, violet) refracts at a slightly different angle; this is called **dispersion**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Dispersion: Why Colors Separate\n\nThe refractive index of water is slightly higher for blue light than for red light. In simple terms:\n\n* **Red light** bends **less** (about 1.331–1.332 refractive index for water).\n* **Blue light** bends **more** (about 1.346–1.347 refractive index).\n\nThis small difference in bending causes the colors to exit the droplet at different angles. The net result is that rays of red light leave a droplet at a wider angle (≈ 42° from the incoming sunlight) than rays of blue light (≈ 40°). When many droplets are present, the collection of these rays produces a continuous spectrum.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Geometry: The 42‑Degree Angle\n\nThe angle at which each color emerges relative to the incoming sunlight is called the **rainbow angle**. For the primary rainbow:\n\n| Color | Approximate Angle (from the incoming ray) |\n|-------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Red   | 42° |\n| Orange| 41° |\n| Yellow| 40° |\n| Green | 39° |\n| Blue  | 38° |\n| Violet| 37° |\n\nBecause the observer is looking **behind** the sun, the angle is measured from the line of sight that is roughly 42° away from the sun. That’s why the rainbow is seen opposite the sun, forming an arc that arches over the horizon.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why We See a Rainbow (not just a Spot)\n\nA single droplet only scatters light in a very narrow range of angles. The human eye, however, is looking at **many thousands of droplets** simultaneously. Each droplet contributes a tiny sliver of the spectrum at its own angle, but because all droplets are distributed over a large volume of air, the light from many droplets overlaps to produce a **continuous band of colors** across the sky.\n\nThe bright band is actually a *concentration* of light within a narrow angular range: the geometry of refraction and reflection forces a large amount of light into that band, making it appear bright.\n\n---\n\n## 5. The Secondary Rainbow\n\nSometimes a fainter, inverted‑color rainbow appears outside the primary arc. It is produced by the same process but with an **extra internal reflection** inside the droplet (three refractions, two reflections). The extra reflection reduces the intensity (hence it is fainter) and reverses the order of the colors:\n\n| Color | Approximate Angle (from the sun) |\n|-------|---------------------------------|\n| Violet| 51° |\n| ...   | ... |\n| Red    | 53° |\n\nThe secondary rainbow’s outer edge is at about 51°–53° from the sun.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Full Circles, Glories, and Other Variants\n\n* **Full Circle** – On a clear, flat surface (e.g., a lake), you can sometimes see a full circular rainbow because there are no obstacles (like the ground) blocking the lower part. In most everyday settings, we only see the top half.\n* **Glory** – A small, inverted, multi‑colored halo that sometimes appears around the anti‑sun (the point directly opposite the sun). It is produced by diffraction and scattering from very small droplets (mist, spray).\n* **Other Halo Phenomena** – 22° halos, 46° halos, etc., are caused by refraction in ice crystals rather than water droplets.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Putting It All Together\n\n1. **Sunlight** (white) reaches the atmosphere.\n2. **Water droplets** (tiny spheres) are present after rain.\n3. Light **refracts** into each droplet, **reflects** off the back, and **refracts** again out.\n4. Different wavelengths refract at slightly different angles → **dispersion**.\n5. The geometry of the droplet and the observer’s viewpoint concentrates light in a narrow angular range (≈42° for red) → a bright, continuous arc of colors opposite the sun.\n6. A second, fainter arc with reversed colors appears farther out (≈51°–53°) because of an extra reflection.\n\nThat’s the full story of how a rainbow forms in the sky—a beautiful interplay of simple physics that turns ordinary water droplets into a spectacular display of color.",

    "completion": "## Why do we see “phases” of the Moon?\n\nThe answer is almost a one‑sentence geometry problem:\n\n> **The fraction of the Moon’s illuminated surface that is visible from Earth changes as the Moon moves around the Earth while the Sun shines on it.**\n\nBecause the Sun is a very distant light source, its rays hit the Moon almost parallel to one another.  \nAt any instant the Sun illuminates one half of the Moon (the “day side”) and the other half remains dark (the “night side”).  \nWhat we see on Earth depends on the *angle* between the Earth‑Moon line and the Sun‑Moon line.\n\n### The geometry in a nutshell\n\n```\n   Sun\n     \\\n      \\   <-- Sunlight\n       \\ \n        •  (Moon)\n         \\\n          \\  <-- Earth\n```\n\n- **New Moon** – The Sun, Moon, and Earth are roughly in a straight line, with the Moon between Earth and Sun.  \n  The illuminated side faces away from us, so we see the dark side.\n\n- **First Quarter** – The Moon is 90° ahead of the Sun in its orbit.  \n  Half of the near side is illuminated, so we see a half‑moon (the right half in the Northern Hemisphere).\n\n- **Full Moon** – The Earth is between the Sun and the Moon.  \n  The entire near side is lit, and we see a bright, round disc.\n\n- **Last Quarter** – The Moon is 90° behind the Sun (again a right angle, but on the other side).  \n  The other half of the near side is illuminated.\n\nBetween these principal points the illuminated fraction grows or shrinks, giving the *waxing* (growing) and *waning* (shrinking) phases.\n\n### The 29.5‑day cycle\n\nThe Moon takes **27.3 days** to orbit the Earth relative to the stars (sidereal month).  \nBecause the Sun is also moving in its own orbit, the Sun‑Moon‑Earth geometry repeats every **29.5 days** – the *synodic month*.  \nThat is why the cycle of phases always lasts about a month.\n\n### Why we always see the same side\n\nThe Moon is tidally locked: it rotates once on its axis for every orbit it makes around Earth.  \nThus the same face of the Moon (the near side) always points toward Earth.  \nBut the *illumination* of that face changes because the Sun’s rays hit it at different angles as the Moon travels around Earth.\n\n### A quick look at the terminator\n\nThe terminator is the line on the Moon that separates the lit half from the dark half.  \nAs the Moon orbits, this line sweeps across the near side.  \nWhen the terminator cuts the disc in half we get a quarter‑moon; when it is near one edge we get a crescent; when it lies on the far side we get a full Moon.\n\n```\n   New → Crescent → First Quarter → Gibbous → Full → Waning Gibbous → Last Quarter → Crescent → New\n```\n\n(The terms “crescent” and “gibbous” refer to the shape of the illuminated portion.)\n\n### Quick summary\n\n| Phase | Angle (Sun–Moon–Earth) | Illuminated fraction |\n|-------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| New   | 0°                     | 0 % (dark)            |\n| Waxing Crescent | 0–90° | 0–50 % |\n| First Quarter | 90° | 50 % |\n| Waxing Gibbous | 90–180° | 50–100 % |\n| Full | 180° | 100 % |\n| Waning Gibbous | 180–270° | 100–50 % |\n| Last Quarter | 270° | 50 % |\n| Waning Crescent | 270–360° | 50–0 % |\n\nBecause the geometry of the Sun–Moon–Earth system repeats every synodic month, we observe the same sequence of phases each month.  \nThe phases are purely an illumination effect—nothing to do with the Moon’s physical shape or color.",

    "completion": "### Renewable vs. Non‑Renewable Energy – The Big Picture\n\n| Feature | Renewable Energy | Non‑Renewable Energy |\n|---------|------------------|----------------------|\n| **Source** | Replenished naturally on human time‑scales (minutes to years). | Finite deposits that are extracted and consumed faster than nature can replace them. |\n| **Availability** | Essentially inexhaustible *if* we harness the right technology (e.g., sunlight, wind, water flow). | Limited by the amount of ore or fossil fuel that exists in the Earth’s crust. |\n| **Carbon Footprint** | Typically very low during operation; some (biomass) can be carbon‑neutral when managed sustainably. | Emits CO₂ and other pollutants when burned; nuclear fission emits little CO₂ but produces long‑lived radioactive waste. |\n| **Economic Trend** | Costs falling rapidly (solar PV, wind turbines). | Prices can rise as reserves dwindle; extraction costs increase with deeper deposits. |\n| **Intermittency & Reliability** | Variable (sunlight, wind speed). Requires storage, grid integration, or backup systems. | Steady output (when operational). Requires continuous fuel supply. |\n| **Geographic Spread** | Can be deployed almost anywhere (solar on roofs, wind farms on coasts). | Concentrated in regions with rich reserves (e.g., Middle East oil, Appalachia coal). |\n| **Environmental Impact** | Lower emissions; land/ water use depends on the technology (solar farms need land, hydro dams alter ecosystems). | Significant impacts: mining, drilling, habitat destruction, water use, and pollution. |\n| **Longevity of Use** | Can operate for decades with minimal resource extraction. | Each extraction reduces the remaining stock; eventually the resource disappears. |\n\n---\n\n## 1. What Makes a Source *Renewable*?\n\n| Energy Type | How it’s Re‑generated | Typical Duration of Replenishment |\n|-------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Solar** | Sun’s radiation is continually produced by nuclear fusion in the Sun. | Infinite (billions of years). |\n| **Wind** | Atmospheric pressure differences cause wind. | Continuous. |\n| **Hydro (Run‑of‑River)** | Water cycles through evaporation, condensation, precipitation. | Continuous. |\n| **Geothermal** | Earth’s internal heat slowly radiates outward. | Very long (millions of years). |\n| **Biomass** | Plants grow by absorbing CO₂ and sunlight (photosynthesis). | Seasonal, but plants can be replanted yearly. |\n| **Tidal & Wave** | Gravitational pull of the Moon & Sun on Earth’s oceans. | Continuous (daily tidal cycles). |\n\n> **Key point:** Even if a renewable resource is “infinite” in principle, the *rate* at which we can access it (e.g., the amount of sunlight that reaches a given roof) limits how much energy we can produce at any moment.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Makes a Source *Non‑Renewable*?\n\n| Energy Type | Source | Lifetime of Reserves | Extraction & Use |\n|-------------|--------|----------------------|------------------|\n| **Coal** | Sedimentary rock formed from plant matter over millions of years. | 50–200 years (depending on reserves and extraction rates). | Open‑pit or underground mining, burned for electricity. |\n| **Oil & Natural Gas** | Fossilized organic matter; gas is often trapped in porous rocks. | 40–100 years (varies widely). | Drilling, refining, combustion or conversion. |\n| **Uranium (Nuclear)** | Mineral deposits in the Earth’s crust. | 150–250 years at current consumption. | Mining, enrichment, fission in reactors. |\n| **Other metals (e.g., rare earths)** | Extracted from ore deposits. | Varies; some are becoming scarce. | Mining and processing. |\n\n> **Key point:** When a non‑renewable resource is extracted and consumed, the total amount in the Earth’s crust is *reduced*—there’s no natural process that can replace it on human timescales.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Practical Implications\n\n| Topic | Renewable | Non‑Renewable |\n|-------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Energy Security** | Less geopolitical risk; can be produced locally. | Depends on global supply chains; subject to political instability. |\n| **Infrastructure Lifespan** | Turbines, solar panels last ~20–30 years; then can be recycled. | Mining infrastructure can be reused, but each new mine requires new capital. |\n| **Economic Growth** | Drives new industries (solar manufacturing, wind turbine fabrication). | Often tied to legacy industries; can be subject to “resource curse.” |\n| **Climate Goals** | Essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. | Major source of CO₂; reducing reliance is key to meeting Paris Agreement targets. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Nuances & Misconceptions\n\n1. **Biomass can be “renewable” but still emit CO₂** if harvested unsustainably (e.g., clearing forests). Sustainable forestry or waste‑based biomass can be carbon‑neutral or even net‑negative.\n2. **Nuclear power** is *not* renewable because it relies on finite uranium, but it produces very low CO₂ per kWh. It sits in a gray area—often grouped with “low‑carbon” rather than renewable.\n3. **Renewable energy is not “free.”** Costs still exist (capital, maintenance, storage). However, the fuel (sunlight, wind, etc.) is essentially free after installation.\n4. **Intermittency is a challenge, not a fundamental flaw.** Advances in battery storage, smart grids, and hybrid systems (e.g., solar + battery + backup gas turbines) mitigate this.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Bottom Line\n\n- **Renewable energy**: Derived from natural processes that replenish themselves on timescales that are negligible compared to human lifespans. They are key to a sustainable, low‑carbon future.\n- **Non‑renewable energy**: Extracted from finite reservoirs that will eventually deplete. While they have powered industrial societies for centuries, continued reliance is unsustainable in the long term.\n\nThe transition to a renewable‑dominated energy mix is not just about swapping one fuel for another—it’s a shift in how we generate, store, and consume power, with profound economic, environmental, and geopolitical ramifications.",

    "prompt": "Why are some metals magnetic while others are not?",
    "completion": "**Short answer:**  \nBecause magnetism in a metal comes from the way its electrons are arranged and how they interact, and only a handful of metals have the right electronic structure (partially filled, high‑density‑of‑states d or f shells and a strong exchange interaction) to lock their spins together in a permanent magnetic state. All other metals either have completely paired electrons (diamagnetic) or only a weak, temperature‑dependent alignment (paramagnetic) and therefore do not stay magnetized.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Where does magnetism come from?\n\n| Type of magnetism | Origin | Typical materials |\n|-------------------|--------|-------------------|\n| **Diamagnetism** | Every electron’s orbital motion produces a tiny current loop that opposes an applied field.  If all electrons are paired, the net moment is zero. | All metals (Cu, Ag, Au, Al, etc.) – weakly repelled by a magnet. |\n| **Paramagnetism** | Unpaired electrons have a magnetic dipole moment.  An external field aligns these moments slightly, but thermal motion (kT) randomises them when the field is removed. | Most transition‑metal oxides, some pure metals (Al, Cu, Zn are very weakly paramagnetic). |\n| **Ferromagnetism** | A quantum‑mechanical *exchange interaction* energetically favours parallel alignment of neighbouring electron spins.  This creates a spontaneous, macroscopic magnetic moment that persists even after the field is removed. | Fe, Co, Ni, some rare‑earths (Gd, Dy), alloys like Permalloy (Ni–Fe). |\n\nThus **only those metals whose electrons can “talk to each other” strongly enough through exchange will become permanently magnetic**. All other metals fall into the diamagnetic or paramagnetic camps.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Atomic magnetic moments → Metal magnetism\n\n### 2.1 Unpaired electrons\n\nThe magnetic moment of an atom is determined by:\n\n- **Spin angular momentum** of unpaired electrons.\n- **Orbital angular momentum** (usually quenched in solids).\n\nIn isolated atoms, the number of unpaired electrons is set by the electronic configuration. For example:\n- **Fe** (3d⁶ 4s²) → 4 unpaired d‑electrons → large atomic moment.\n- **Cu** (3d¹⁰ 4s¹) → all d‑electrons paired → no net moment.\n\n### 2.2 Delocalised electrons in a metal\n\nIn a metal, the outer electrons form a *conduction band* that is spread over the entire crystal. Two key changes occur:\n\n1. **Band broadening:** The discrete atomic levels become bands of allowed energies.\n2. **Exchange splitting:** If the exchange energy is large enough, the band splits into a spin‑up and a spin‑down sub‑band, lowering the energy of one spin orientation.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  The Stoner Criterion – when does a metal become ferromagnetic?\n\nThe Stoner model gives a simple test for itinerant‑electron ferromagnetism:\n\n\\[\nN(E_F) \\, I \\; > \\; 1\n\\]\n\n- \\(N(E_F)\\) = density of electronic states at the Fermi energy (number of electrons per energy per volume).  \n- \\(I\\) = exchange integral (strength of the exchange interaction, roughly 0.7–1 eV for 3d metals).\n\n**Why this matters**\n\n- **High \\(N(E_F)\\)** means many electrons are available to align their spins without a large energy cost.  \n- **Large \\(I\\)** means the exchange interaction strongly favours parallel alignment.\n\n**Typical values**\n\n| Metal | \\(N(E_F)\\) (states/eV·atom) | \\(I\\) (eV) | \\(N I\\) | Ferromagnet? |\n|-------|----------------------------|-----------|---------|--------------|\n| Fe | ~2.5 | 0.9 | 2.25 | Yes |\n| Co | ~2.0 | 0.9 | 1.8 | Yes |\n| Ni | ~1.7 | 0.9 | 1.53 | Yes |\n| Cu | ~1.1 | 0.9 | 0.99 | No |\n| Al | ~0.7 | 0.9 | 0.63 | No |\n\n> **Result:** The three “conventional” ferromagnets (Fe, Co, Ni) satisfy the Stoner criterion; most other metals do not.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Why do some “non‑magnetic” metals *sometimes* show magnetic behaviour?\n\n| Situation | Mechanism | Example |\n|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| **Alloying** | Introducing a small amount of a ferromagnetic element changes the electronic structure locally. | Fe–Ni alloys (Permalloy) are highly soft magnetic. |\n| **Low temperatures** | Reducing thermal disorder can push a borderline metal into the ferromagnetic regime. | Certain 3d transition‑metal hydrides become magnetic below a few Kelvin. |\n| **High pressure** | Compressing the lattice increases band overlap, raising \\(N(E_F)\\). | Fe becomes non‑magnetic in the hcp phase under very high pressure (but is ferromagnetic at ambient). |\n| **Defects / vacancies** | Localised states can trap electrons and create moments. | Copper with vacancies can show paramagnetic resonance. |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  The role of crystal structure and temperature\n\n- **Crystal symmetry** determines how the d‑orbitals split (crystal‑field splitting). If the splitting is small compared to the exchange energy, spins prefer to align.\n- **Temperature**: Above the Curie temperature (\\(T_C\\)) thermal energy overcomes exchange coupling and the material becomes paramagnetic.  \n  - Fe: \\(T_C ≈ 1043 K\\)  \n  - Co: \\(T_C ≈ 1394 K\\)  \n  - Ni: \\(T_C ≈ 631 K\\)\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Quick checklist for a metal to be magnetic\n\n| Requirement | Typical value |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| Partially filled d (or f) band | Yes |\n| High density of states at Fermi level | \\(> 1 \\text{state/eV·atom}\\) |\n| Exchange integral \\(I \\gtrsim 0.6 \\text{eV}\\) | Yes |\n| Meets Stoner criterion \\(N(E_F) I > 1\\) | Yes |\n| Temperature below Curie point | Yes |\n\nIf any of these fail, the metal will be either diamagnetic or only weakly paramagnetic.\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Bottom line\n\n- **Magnetism** is fundamentally an electronic property: the presence and alignment of unpaired electron spins.\n- **Metals** differ in whether their conduction electrons can align via exchange.  \n  - **Fe, Co, Ni** (and some rare‑earths) have the right band structure and exchange energy → ferromagnetic.  \n  - **Cu, Ag, Al, Zn** have either filled bands or very low density of states → diamagnetic or paramagnetic.\n- **Temperature, pressure, alloying, and defects** can shift a metal into or out of magnetic ordering, but the underlying electronic structure is the deciding factor.\n\nSo, the reason only a few metals are magnetic is that only those few have a partially filled, high‑density‑of‑states d or f band that satisfies the exchange‑driven Stoner criterion, allowing their electron spins to lock together into a permanent magnetic moment. All others lack that special electronic configuration and therefore stay non‑magnetic.",

    "prompt": "Describe how photosynthesis works, focusing on the role of chlorophyll.",
    "completion": "**Photosynthesis in a nutshell**\n\nPlants, algae and some bacteria use light energy to turn carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O) into sugars (mainly glucose) and oxygen (O₂). The overall reaction is:\n\n```\n6 CO₂ + 6 H₂O + light energy  →  C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6 O₂\n```\n\nThe process takes place in chloroplasts, inside a special membrane system called the thylakoid. The key player that captures the light energy and starts the whole chain of events is the pigment **chlorophyll**. Below is a step‑by‑step look at how chlorophyll drives photosynthesis.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is chlorophyll?\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Chemical structure** | A porphyrin ring (like in hemoglobin) with a central Mg²⁺ ion and a long phytyl side chain that anchors it in the thylakoid membrane. |\n| **Types** | Chlorophyll‑a (primary reaction‑center pigment) and chlorophyll‑b (accessory light‑harvesting pigment). |\n| **Light absorption** | Peaks at ~430 nm (blue) and ~662 nm (red); it reflects green (~495–570 nm), which is why plants look green. |\n| **Location** | Embedded in protein complexes: the reaction center (RC) of Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I (PSI), and in light‑harvesting complexes (LHC) that flank the RC. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Light‑dependent reactions – the “first half” of photosynthesis\n\n1. **Light absorption & excitation**  \n   - A photon strikes a chlorophyll molecule in the LHC.  \n   - The energy excites an electron from its ground state (S₀) to an excited state (S₁).  \n   - Excited chlorophyll transfers its energy to a chlorophyll in the reaction center (the *special pair*, P680 in PSII, P700 in PSI) via resonance energy transfer.  \n   - This energy is enough to eject the electron from the chlorophyll’s porphyrin ring, creating a *photo‑excited* chlorophyll and an *excited* electron.\n\n2. **Charge separation & electron transport**  \n   - The excited electron is passed to an acceptor (pheophytin) in PSII, creating a permanently oxidized chlorophyll (Cl⁺).  \n   - The loss of an electron leaves the reaction‑center chlorophyll with a **positive charge**.  \n   - This drives a chain of electron carriers (plastoquinone, cytochrome b₆f, plastocyanin, PSI, and NADP⁺ reductase).  \n   - As electrons move through the chain, their energy is used to pump protons (H⁺) from the stroma into the thylakoid lumen, building a proton gradient.\n\n3. **Photophosphorylation**  \n   - The proton gradient powers ATP synthase, turning ADP + Pi into ATP.  \n   - When electrons reach PSI, another photon excites them again, allowing them to reduce NADP⁺ to NADPH.\n\n4. **Water splitting (Oxygen evolution)**  \n   - PSII must replace the electron lost from its chlorophyll.  \n   - A water‑splitting complex (the oxygen‑evolving complex) uses the energy from the electron transport chain to split 2 H₂O → 4 H⁺ + 4 e⁻ + O₂.  \n   - The released O₂ diffuses out of the chloroplast.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Light‑independent reactions – the “second half” (Calvin cycle)\n\n- **Carbon fixation:** CO₂ is fixed into 3‑phosphoglycerate (3‑PGA) by the enzyme Rubisco, using the ATP and NADPH produced in the light‑dependent stage.  \n- **Regeneration:** The cycle then regenerates ribulose‑bisphosphate (RuBP) so the cycle can continue.  \n- **Sugar production:** After several turns, the cycle produces glyceraldehyde‑3‑phosphate (G3P), which can be converted into glucose and other carbohydrates.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why chlorophyll is the linchpin\n\n| Role | How chlorophyll fulfills it |\n|------|-----------------------------|\n| **Photon capture** | Its conjugated ring system absorbs photons in the red‑blue region. |\n| **Energy funneling** | Excited chlorophylls transfer energy to the reaction‑center chlorophylls efficiently. |\n| **Charge separation** | The excited electron is removed, leaving a stable oxidized chlorophyll that can start the electron transport chain. |\n| **Structural anchor** | Its hydrophobic tail embeds the pigment in the thylakoid membrane, positioning it correctly within protein complexes. |\n| **Color** | The specific absorption spectrum explains why plants appear green (they reflect green light). |\n\nWithout chlorophyll, plants would have no way to convert light into chemical energy, and photosynthesis would not occur. Chlorophyll’s unique electronic properties make it the central “solar cell” of every green organism.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Quick recap\n\n1. **Light hits chlorophyll → electron excited.**  \n2. **Excited electron → reaction‑center chlorophyll → electron transport chain → proton gradient → ATP & NADPH.**  \n3. **Water is split → O₂ released.**  \n4. **ATP + NADPH → Calvin cycle → sugars.**\n\nChlorophyll’s role is the initiation and orchestration of this entire cascade, turning photons into the energy currency that fuels life on Earth.",

    "prompt": "Explain the concept of supply and demand in economics.",
    "completion": "### The Basic Idea\n\n**Supply** and **demand** are the two forces that determine the price and quantity of goods and services in a market.  \n- **Demand** reflects how many buyers are willing and able to purchase a good at each possible price.  \n- **Supply** reflects how many sellers are willing and able to offer a good for sale at each possible price.\n\nWhen the two forces meet, a **market equilibrium** is achieved: the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, and a stable price emerges.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Demand\n\n| Key Law | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Law of Demand** | All else equal, as the price of a good falls, the quantity demanded **increases**; as the price rises, the quantity demanded **decreases**. |\n| **Demand Curve** | A downward‑sloping line on a graph where price (P) is on the vertical axis and quantity demanded (Qd) is on the horizontal axis. Each point on the curve represents a different price and the corresponding quantity buyers would purchase. |\n\n### Factors that *shift* the demand curve (change the whole curve)\n| Factor | Typical Effect on Demand |\n|--------|--------------------------|\n| Consumer income | ↑ income → ↑ demand for normal goods; ↓ demand for inferior goods |\n| Preferences/ tastes | Positive advertising → ↑ demand |\n| Prices of related goods | Higher price of a substitute → ↑ demand; higher price of a complement → ↓ demand |\n| Expectations of future prices | Expect higher future price → ↑ current demand |\n| Population | ↑ population → ↑ demand |\n\n*Movement along the curve* is caused by a change in price only.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Supply\n\n| Key Law | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Law of Supply** | All else equal, as the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied **increases**; as the price falls, the quantity supplied **decreases**. |\n| **Supply Curve** | An upward‑sloping line on a graph with price (P) on the vertical axis and quantity supplied (Qs) on the horizontal axis. Each point represents a different price and the corresponding quantity sellers would provide. |\n\n### Factors that *shift* the supply curve (change the whole curve)\n| Factor | Typical Effect on Supply |\n|--------|--------------------------|\n| Production technology | Better tech → ↑ supply (shift right) |\n| Input prices | ↑ cost of inputs (e.g., labor, raw materials) → ↓ supply (shift left) |\n| Number of sellers | More sellers → ↑ supply |\n| Expectations of future prices | Expect higher future price → ↑ current supply |\n| Taxes/subsidies | Higher taxes → ↓ supply; subsidies → ↑ supply |\n\n*Movement along the curve* is caused by a change in price only.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Market Equilibrium\n\n- **Equilibrium price (P\\*)**: where **Qd = Qs**.\n- **Equilibrium quantity (Q\\*)**: the amount sold at P\\*.\n\nIf the market price is above P\\*, **excess supply** (surplus) occurs; sellers lower prices to sell inventory.  \nIf the price is below P\\*, **excess demand** (shortage) occurs; buyers compete, pushing the price up.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Illustrative Example: Coffee\n\n| Situation | What happens? |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| A new coffee‑machine tech cuts brewing time | **Supply increases** (rightward shift); price tends to fall. |\n| A global coffee‑bean shortage | **Supply decreases** (leftward shift); price tends to rise. |\n| A popular health study promotes coffee’s benefits | **Demand increases** (rightward shift); price rises. |\n| Prices of tea rise | **Demand for coffee increases** (substitute effect). |\n| Inflation reduces consumer income | Demand for coffee (a normal good) decreases; price falls. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Elasticity – How Sensitive are the Curves?\n\n- **Price elasticity of demand** measures how much quantity demanded changes when price changes.  \n  - Elastic (|E| > 1): quantity changes a lot.  \n  - Inelastic (|E| < 1): quantity changes little.\n\n- **Price elasticity of supply** measures how much quantity supplied changes when price changes.\n\nElasticities help predict the magnitude of shifts in supply or demand and the resulting price/quantity changes.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Key Take‑aways\n\n1. **Supply and demand curves intersect at the equilibrium price and quantity.**  \n2. **Changes in price move along the curves; changes in other factors shift the curves.**  \n3. **Market forces automatically adjust prices to clear markets, creating surpluses or shortages that prompt price changes.**  \n4. **Elasticities tell us how responsive quantity is to price changes.**\n\nUnderstanding these fundamentals is the first step to analyzing any market, from everyday consumer goods to complex financial instruments.",

    "prompt": "Why do seasons change on Earth?",
    "completion": "**In short:** Seasons are the result of Earth’s ~23.5° axial tilt combined with its orbit around the Sun.  \nAs Earth travels around the Sun, the tilt keeps one hemisphere pointed toward the Sun while the other is angled away, so the two sides of the planet receive different amounts of direct sunlight, for different lengths of day, and therefore different temperatures.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The two key ingredients\n\n| Ingredient | What it does | Why it matters |\n|------------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Axial tilt (obliquity)** | 23.5° tilt of Earth’s rotation axis relative to the plane of its orbit (the ecliptic). | Makes the Sun’s apparent path in the sky rise higher in summer and lower in winter for each hemisphere. |\n| **Orbital motion** | Earth orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days. | The tilt is fixed in space (to a good approximation), so the orientation of the axis relative to the Sun changes continuously as Earth goes around. |\n\n### Why the tilt matters more than the orbit’s shape\n\n- Earth’s orbit is slightly elliptical (eccentricity ≈ 0.0167), so the Sun‑Earth distance varies by only ~3 %. That changes solar energy by < 7 %.  \n- The axial tilt, however, changes the *angle* at which solar rays strike each latitude. Near the equator the change is modest, but at higher latitudes the difference can be huge: the sun’s rays can strike almost perpendicular in summer but at a shallow angle in winter, reducing the energy received by a factor of 3–4.  \n- Consequently, the tilt dominates the seasonal temperature swings; the distance effect is a secondary, small tweak.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  How the seasons unfold\n\n1. **Equinoxes (≈ March 21 and September 23)**  \n   - The Sun is directly over the equator.  \n   - Day and night are about equal everywhere.  \n   - The axial tilt is perpendicular to the Sun; neither hemisphere receives more direct sunlight.\n\n2. **Solstices (≈ June 21 and December 21)**  \n   - The Sun is directly over the Tropic of Cancer (≈ 23.5° N) in the Northern Hemisphere’s summer solstice, or over the Tropic of Capricorn (≈ 23.5° S) in the Southern Hemisphere’s summer solstice.  \n   - The hemisphere tilted toward the Sun gets:\n     - **More direct (steeper) sunlight** → higher solar intensity.  \n     - **Longer daylight** → more hours of heating.  \n   - The opposite hemisphere receives:\n     - **Lower (more oblique) sunlight** → less intensity.  \n     - **Shorter daylight** → less heating.\n\n3. **Progression through the year**  \n   - As Earth moves along its orbit, the tilt continuously changes the Sun’s apparent latitude.  \n   - Each location on Earth experiences a cycle of increasing then decreasing insolation, which is what we call “spring → summer → autumn → winter” in the respective hemisphere.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  A few additional points\n\n| Point | Explanation |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Why winter can be colder even when Earth is closer to the Sun (perihelion)** | In the Northern Hemisphere, perihelion occurs in early January when the North is tilted away from the Sun. The tilt’s effect on insolation outweighs the small increase in solar flux due to the closer distance. |\n| **Seasonal length differences between hemispheres** | Because Earth’s orbit is slightly elliptical, the Earth moves faster near perihelion and slower near aphelion. The Northern Hemisphere’s winter (near perihelion) is a bit longer than its summer, while the Southern Hemisphere’s summer (near aphelion) is a bit longer than its winter. |\n| **Precession of the equinoxes** | Over ~26 000 years, Earth’s axis slowly wobbles (precesses). This shifts the timing of the equinoxes/solstices relative to the stars, but it does not change the basic seasonal cycle on a yearly timescale. |\n| **Impact on life** | The seasonal changes in light and temperature drive plant phenology, animal migrations, and human activities (agriculture, heating/cooling, holidays). |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Visualizing it\n\nImagine Earth as a spinning top tilted 23.5° relative to the line that connects it to the Sun. As the top whirls around the Sun, one side of the top leans toward the Sun while the other leans away. The side that leans in receives a bright, direct beam of light for a longer portion of the day; the side that leans away receives a dimmer, more glancing beam for a shorter portion. That’s why the Northern Hemisphere has a long, hot summer and a short, cold winter, while the Southern Hemisphere experiences the opposite, and why the seasons are essentially a 12‑month rhythm driven by geometry, not distance.",

    "completion": "**Cellular respiration is the way our cells turn food into usable energy.**  \nThink of it like a tiny factory that burns fuel (glucose) to power everything the body needs to do.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Fuel‑up: Glycolysis (the first step)**  \n- **Where?** In the cell’s “cytoplasm” (the fluid inside the cell).  \n- **What happens?** One glucose molecule (a 6‑carbon sugar) is split into two 3‑carbon molecules called pyruvate.  \n- **Energy outcome:**  \n  - 2 ATP molecules (the cell’s “quick‑cash” energy) are made.  \n  - 2 NADH molecules (electron carriers that will bring the energy deeper into the cell).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **The “Power Plant” – the Krebs (Citric Acid) Cycle**  \n- **Where?** Inside the mitochondria, the cell’s energy factories.  \n- **What happens?** Each pyruvate is turned into a small molecule that enters a cycle of reactions.  \n- **Energy outcome:**  \n  - 2 ATP molecules (per glucose).  \n  - 6 NADH and 2 FADH₂ molecules (more electron carriers).  \n  - Releases CO₂ (a waste gas).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **The Big Energy Store – Electron Transport Chain (ETC)**  \n- **Where?** Inside the inner membrane of the mitochondria.  \n- **What happens?** NADH and FADH₂ donate their electrons to a series of proteins.  \n- **Energy outcome:**  \n  - A large “electricity” flow builds up across the membrane.  \n  - This drives the creation of **about 28 ATP** (the majority of the cell’s usable energy).  \n  - Oxygen is the final electron “acceptor”; it combines with electrons and hydrogen to form water (H₂O).  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **The Result – Total Energy Production**  \n- **Per glucose molecule:**  \n  - ~30–32 ATP molecules (the exact number can vary).  \n  - CO₂ and H₂O as waste products.  \n\n---\n\n### Why It Matters  \n- **ATP** is the universal energy currency; it powers muscle contraction, nerve impulses, cell growth, and many other essential processes.  \n- **Oxygen** is required for the final step; that’s why we need to breathe.  \n- The whole process is highly efficient and tightly regulated, ensuring cells get just the energy they need and nothing wasted.\n\n---\n\n#### Quick Analogy  \n- **Glycolysis** = chopping a log into smaller pieces.  \n- **Krebs Cycle** = feeding those pieces into a boiler.  \n- **Electron Transport Chain** = the boiler’s turbine generating electricity.  \n- **ATP** = the batteries you use to power gadgets.  \n\nThat’s cellular respiration in a nutshell—cells burn glucose with oxygen to harvest energy, release waste, and keep everything running smoothly.",
