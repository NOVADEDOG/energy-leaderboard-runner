The exact shade can vary depending on the proportions of red and blue used\u2014more red might result in a redder purple, while more blue could produce a bluer purple. However, the general outcome is always a shade of purple in subtractive color mixing (as used in paint). \n\nIn contrast, mixing red and blue light (additive color mixing) results in **magenta**, but the question specifically refers to paint, so the answer is **purple**. \ud83c\udfa8",
