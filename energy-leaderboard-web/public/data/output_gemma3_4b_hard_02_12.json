Therefore, 17 is prime.\n\n6.  **Test 19:** 19 is only divisible by 1 and 19.

If a number could be divided evenly by another number, it wasn't prime. Only when a number remained divisible only by 1 and itself was it identified as a prime number.\n",

We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nS = (n/2) * (a + l)\n\nWhere:\n*   S = the sum of the series\n*   n = the number of terms in the series\n*   a = the first term\n*   l = the last term\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Identify the values:**\n    *   a = 2 (the first even number)\n    *   l = 50 (the last even number)\n\n2.  **Find the number of terms (n):**\n    The even numbers between 1 and 50 are 2, 4, 6, ..., 50.  This can be represented as 2*1, 2*2, 2*3, ..., 2*25.  Therefore, there are 25 terms. So, n = 25.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula:**\n    S = (25/2) * (2 + 50)\n    S = (25/2) * 52\n    S = 25 * 26\n    S = 650\n\n**Therefore, the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 50 inclusive is 650.**\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of the first n even numbers. The sum of the first 'n' even numbers is n(n+1). In our case, we want the sum of even numbers up to 50. The largest even number less than or equal to 50 is 50, so n = 25. Therefore the sum is 25(25+1) = 25 * 26 = 650.\n",

This is a classic permutation problem.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* **Permutations:**  A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. In this case, we want to arrange the 5 distinct marbles (red, green, blue, yellow, purple) in a row.\n* **The Formula:** The number of ways to arrange *n* distinct objects in a row is given by the factorial of *n*, written as n!.  The factorial is calculated as: n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nWe have 5 marbles, so n = 5.  Therefore:\n\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThere are 120 different orders in which you can arrange the five marbles.\n\n**In simpler terms:**\n\n* You have 5 choices for the first marble.\n* After choosing the first marble, you have 4 remaining marbles to choose from for the second position.\n* Then you have 3 choices left for the third position.\n* Then 2 choices for the fourth position.\n* Finally, only 1 choice remains for the last position.\n\nMultiplying these possibilities together (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120) gives you the total number of different arrangements.",

It raises a `ValueError` if `n` is less than 0, as the factorial is not defined for negative numbers. This makes the function more robust.\n* **Base Case:** The code correctly handles the base case of `n == 0`, returning 1, which is the factorial of 0.\n* **Clear Documentation:**  A detailed docstring explains what the function does, its arguments, what it returns, and the potential exceptions it can raise. This is essential for maintainability and usability.\n* **Iterative Approach:** Uses an iterative `for` loop, which is generally more efficient than recursive solutions for factorial calculations, especially for larger numbers, as it avoids the overhead of function calls and potential stack overflow errors.\n* **Efficiency:** The loop directly calculates the factorial.  It's clear and easy to understand.\n* **Readability:** The code is well-formatted and uses descriptive variable names (`result`, `i`, `n`).\n* **Example Usage with Error Handling:** The example demonstrates how to use the function and, importantly, how to catch the `ValueError` if an invalid input is provided.  This shows how to use the function correctly and handle potential problems.\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. **Input Validation:** Checks if `n` is negative. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised with a helpful message.\n2. **Base Case:** If `n` is 0, it returns 1 because 0! = 1.\n3. **Iterative Calculation:** If `n` is positive:\n   - It initializes `result` to 1.\n   - It iterates from 1 up to and including `n`.\n   - In each iteration, it multiplies `result` by the current value of `i`.\n   - After the loop finishes, `result` holds the factorial of `n`.\n4. **Return Value:** The function returns the calculated `result`.\n\nThis revised answer is much more complete, robust, and demonstrates best practices in Python programming. It directly addresses the prompt's requirements, includes important error handling, and is thoroughly documented.\n",

    "completion": "Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step.\n\n**1. The Formula:**\n\nWe start with the formula for the area of a circle:\n   A = \u03c0r\u00b2\n\n   Where:\n   * A = Area of the circle\n   * \u03c0 (pi) \u2248 3.14159\n   * r = radius of the circle\n\n**2. Doubling the Radius:**\n\nLet's say the original radius is 'r'.  If we double the radius, the new radius (r') becomes 2r.\n\n**3. Calculate the New Area (A'):**\n\nNow we substitute the new radius (2r) into the area formula:\n\n   A' = \u03c0(2r)\u00b2\n   A' = \u03c0(4r\u00b2)\n   A' = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\n**4. Comparing the Areas:**\n\nWe can see that:\n* Original area: A = \u03c0r\u00b2\n* New area: A' = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\n**5. The Factor of Increase:**\n\nTo find out by what factor the area increases, we can compare the new area (A') to the original area (A):\n\n   A' / A = (4\u03c0r\u00b2) / (\u03c0r\u00b2)\n   A' / A = 4\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhen the radius of a circle is doubled, the area increases by a factor of **4**.  In other words, the area becomes four times larger.\n\n**Why this happens:**\n\nThe area formula (A = \u03c0r\u00b2) is a quadratic equation.  When you square the radius (r\u00b2) the result is multiplied by \u03c0.  Doubling the radius means you're squaring the new radius (2r), which results in 4r\u00b2.  Multiplying 4r\u00b2 by \u03c0 gives you 4\u03c0r\u00b2, which is four times the original area (\u03c0r\u00b2).",
