    "completion": "**Pseudocode**\n\n```\nfunction reverseString(s)\n    // s \u2013 input string (e.g. \"hello world\")\n    n      \u2190 length(s)          // number of characters\n    rev    \u2190 empty string\n\n    // Walk the original string from the last character to the first\n    for i from n-1 downto 0\n        rev \u2190 rev + s[i]        // append the current char to rev\n    end for\n\n    return rev                  // rev now holds the reversed string\nend function\n```\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. `length(s)` gives the number of characters in the string.  \n2. We start at the **last index** (`n-1`) and step backwards (`downto 0`).  \n3. Each character `s[i]` is appended to the new string `rev`.  \n4. After the loop, `rev` contains the original characters in reverse order, e.g. `\"dlrow olleh\"` for `\"hello world\"`.\n\n---\n\n### Quick\u2011and\u2011dirty Python alternative\n\n```python\ns = \"hello world\"\nreversed_s = s[::-1]          # slice syntax: start:end:step\nprint(reversed_s)   # outputs: dlrow olleh\n```\n\nThe `[::-1]` slice returns a new string made by stepping through `s` backward. This is a built\u2011in, concise way to reverse a string.",
