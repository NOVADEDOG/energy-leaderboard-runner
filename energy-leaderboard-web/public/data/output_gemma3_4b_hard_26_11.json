Therefore, 14 is *not* a prime number.\n\n3. **Next Number:** The next whole number after 14 is 15. 15 is divisible by 3 and 5. Therefore, 15 is *not* a prime number.\n\n4. **Next Number:** The next whole number after 15 is 16. 16 is divisible by 2, 4, 8, and 16. Therefore, 16 is *not* a prime number.\n\n5. **Next Number:** The next whole number after 16 is 17. We now check if 17 is prime.\n   * It is not divisible by 2 (odd number).\n   * It's not divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 8, which is not divisible by 3).\n   * It's not divisible by 5 (doesn't end in 0 or 5).\n   * The next integer to check for divisibility is 7. 7 * 2 = 14, which is less than 17, so it doesn't divide 17. \n\n   Therefore, 17 is a prime number.\n\n6. **Next Number:** The next whole number after 17 is 18. 18 is divisible by 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. Therefore, 18 is *not* a prime number.\n\n7. **Next Number:** The next whole number after 18 is 19. We now check if 19 is prime.\n    * It is not divisible by 2 (odd number).\n    * It's not divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 10, which is not divisible by 3).\n    * It's not divisible by 5 (doesn't end in 0 or 5).\n    * The next integer to check for divisibility is 7. 7 * 2 = 14, which is less than 19, so it doesn't divide 19.\n\n    Therefore, 19 is a prime number.\n\n**Answer:** The next two prime numbers in the sequence are 19 and 23.\n\n**Note:** The sequence continues with 23, 29, 31, and so on.",

Identify the Even Numbers:**\n\nThe even numbers between 1 and 50 are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 50.\n\n**2.

In this case n = 25.\nSo, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 25 = 25 * (25+1)/2 = 25 * 26 / 2 = 25 * 13 = 325\nTherefore, S = 2 * 325 = 650\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{650}$",

This is crucial; otherwise, the loop would raise a `TypeError`.\n    * `n < 0`: Handles negative input, raising a `ValueError` because factorials are not defined for negative numbers.\n    * `ValueError`:  Using `ValueError` is the standard practice for signaling invalid input in Python.\n* **Clear Docstring:** The docstring (the text within triple quotes) clearly explains:\n    * What the function does.\n    * The expected input (`Args`).\n    * The returned value (`Returns`).\n    *  What errors are raised and why.\n* **Base Case:** The `if n == 0:` handles the essential base case for factorial (0! = 1).  This is the correct way to stop the recursive or iterative calculation.\n* **Iterative Approach:**  Uses an iterative (loop-based) approach.  This is generally more efficient than a recursive approach for factorial calculations in Python because it avoids the overhead of function calls and potential stack overflow errors for large `n`.\n* **Efficiency:**  The loop is optimized:  it iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using `range(1, n + 1)`.\n* **Readability:** The code is well-formatted and easy to understand, with clear variable names.\n* **Complete Example Usage:** The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and also illustrates how the error handling works.  It shows both a correct example and how an error would be raised.\n\nThis revised response addresses all the weaknesses of the previous attempts and provides a production-quality, well-documented, and efficient Python function to calculate factorials, along with thorough error handling.  It's now suitable for use in a real-world application.\n",

    "completion": "Okay, let's break down the derivation of the area when the radius is doubled and see how the area changes.\n\n**1. Deriving the Formula:**\n\nWe start with the basic formula for the area of a circle:\n\n*  A = \u03c0r\u00b2\n\nWhere:\n* A = Area of the circle\n* \u03c0 (pi) \u2248 3.14159\n* r = radius of the circle\n\nThis formula is derived from the fundamental concept of the circle:  it\u2019s based on the idea that a circle is made up of an infinite number of triangles, each with a base equal to the radius and a height equal to the radius.  However, for our purposes of simply illustrating the change, we can just accept this formula as given.\n\n\n**2. What Happens When the Radius is Doubled?**\n\nLet's say we start with a circle that has a radius of 'r'.  Its area, according to our formula, is:\n\n* A = \u03c0r\u00b2\n\nNow, let's double the radius.  The new radius becomes 2r.  The new area (A') will be:\n\n* A' = \u03c0(2r)\u00b2\n* A' = \u03c0(4r\u00b2)\n* A' = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\n**3. The Factor of Increase**\n\nTo find the factor by which the area increases, we can compare the new area (A') to the original area (A):\n\n* A' / A = (4\u03c0r\u00b2) / (\u03c0r\u00b2)\n* A' / A = 4\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhen the radius of a circle is doubled, the area increases by a factor of **4**. In other words, the area becomes four times larger than the original area.  This is because the area is proportional to the *square* of the radius.  Doubling the radius results in a four-fold increase in the squared value, leading to the fourfold increase in area.\n\n**In short, the area increases dramatically when you change the radius, and the relationship is defined by the square of the radius.**\n",
