If we want to find the number of ways to arrange the 5 marbles, one by one, we would have:\n\n* First marble: 5 choices (red, green, blue, yellow, or purple)\n* Second marble: 4 remaining choices\n* Third marble: 3 remaining choices\n* Fourth marble: 2 remaining choices\n* Fifth marble: 1 remaining choice\n\nBy multiplying the number of choices at each step, we get:\n\n5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120\n\nThis confirms that there are indeed 120 different orders in which you can arrange these 5 marbles.",

However, they also have some significant drawbacks, such as limited range and charging time, higher upfront costs, and potential battery degradation over time. Despite these challenges, many experts believe that electric cars offer a promising sustainable transportation solution for the future, particularly as technology continues to improve and charging infrastructure expands.",
