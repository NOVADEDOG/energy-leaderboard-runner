So after 13 we only need to examine the odd numbers 15,\u202f17,\u202f19,\u202f21,\u202f\u2026\n\n2. **Test each odd candidate for divisibility by the primes we already know** (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13).  \n   - **15** is divisible by\u202f3 (or\u202f5), so it\u2019s not prime.  \n   - **17**:  \n     - Not divisible by\u202f2 (it\u2019s odd).  \n     - Sum of its digits is 1\u202f+\u202f7\u202f=\u202f8, not a multiple of\u202f3 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f3.  \n     - Ends in 7 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n     - \\(7^2 = 49 > 17\\), so the only possible divisors we need to check are primes \u2264\u202f\u221a17 \u2248\u202f4.1, i.e., 2 and 3. Since it\u2019s not divisible by either, 17 is prime.  \n   - **19**:  \n     - Odd \u2192 not divisible by\u202f2.  \n     - Digit sum 1\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f10 \u2192 not a multiple of\u202f3.  \n     - Ends in 9 \u2192 not divisible by\u202f5.  \n     - \u221a19 \u2248\u202f4.36, so again only 2 and 3 need to be checked. It passes, so 19 is prime.\n\n3. **Stop when we have the required number of primes.** After confirming 17 and 19 are prime, we have the next two primes in the sequence.\n\n---\n\n### Quick check with the \u201csquare\u2011root rule\u201d\n\nFor any candidate \\(n\\), you only need to test divisibility by primes \u2264\u202f\u221an:\n\n- For 17, \u221a17\u202f\u2248\u202f4.1 \u2192 test 2,\u202f3. None divide 17 \u2192 prime.  \n- For 19, \u221a19\u202f\u2248\u202f4.4 \u2192 test 2,\u202f3. None divide 19 \u2192 prime.\n\nThus the sequence continues:\n\n\\[\n2,\\;3,\\;5,\\;7,\\;11,\\;13,\\;\\boxed{17},\\;\\boxed{19},\\dots\n\\]",
