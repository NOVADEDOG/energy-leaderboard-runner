    "completion": "To determine how the area of a circle changes when its radius is doubled, we start with the standard formula for the area of a circle:\n\n$$\nA = \\pi r^2\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Original Area\nLet the original radius be $ r $. Then the original area is:\n\n$$\nA = \\pi r^2\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: New Radius and New Area\nIf the radius is doubled, the new radius becomes $ 2r $. Substituting this into the formula:\n\n$$\nA' = \\pi (2r)^2\n$$\n\nNow, compute the square of $ 2r $:\n\n$$\n(2r)^2 = 4r^2\n$$\n\nSo the new area becomes:\n\n$$\nA' = \\pi \\cdot 4r^2 = 4\\pi r^2\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Comparing the New Area to the Original\nThe original area was $ \\pi r^2 $, and the new area is $ 4\\pi r^2 $. Therefore, the new area is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{A'}{A} = \\frac{4\\pi r^2}{\\pi r^2} = 4\n$$\n\nThis shows that the area increases by a factor of **4** when the radius is doubled.\n\n---\n\n### General Insight\nThe area of a circle is proportional to the square of the radius. So, if the radius is scaled by a factor of $ k $, the area is scaled by $ k^2 $. In this case, $ k = 2 $, so the area increases by:\n\n$$\nk^2 = 2^2 = 4\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nWhen the radius is doubled, the area increases by a factor of \\boxed{4}.",
