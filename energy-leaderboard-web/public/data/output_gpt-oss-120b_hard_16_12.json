So after 13 we only need to examine the odd numbers 15, 17, 19, 21, …\n\n2. **Test each odd candidate for divisibility by the primes we already know** (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13).  \n   - **15** is divisible by 3 (or 5), so it’s not prime.  \n   - **17**:  \n     - Not divisible by 2 (it’s odd).  \n     - Sum of its digits is 1 + 7 = 8, not a multiple of 3 → not divisible by 3.  \n     - Ends in 7 → not divisible by 5.  \n     - \\(7^2 = 49 > 17\\), so the only possible divisors we need to check are primes ≤ √17 ≈ 4.1, i.e., 2 and 3. Since it’s not divisible by either, 17 is prime.  \n   - **19**:  \n     - Odd → not divisible by 2.  \n     - Digit sum 1 + 9 = 10 → not a multiple of 3.  \n     - Ends in 9 → not divisible by 5.  \n     - √19 ≈ 4.36, so again only 2 and 3 need to be checked. It passes, so 19 is prime.\n\n3. **Stop when we have the required number of primes.** After confirming 17 and 19 are prime, we have the next two primes in the sequence.\n\n---\n\n### Quick check with the “square‑root rule”\n\nFor any candidate \\(n\\), you only need to test divisibility by primes ≤ √n:\n\n- For 17, √17 ≈ 4.1 → test 2, 3. None divide 17 → prime.  \n- For 19, √19 ≈ 4.4 → test 2, 3. None divide 19 → prime.\n\nThus the sequence continues:\n\n\\[\n2,\\;3,\\;5,\\;7,\\;11,\\;13,\\;\\boxed{17},\\;\\boxed{19},\\dots\n\\]",
