    "completion": "The main pro of electric cars is their significantly lower operating costs compared to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, as electricity is generally cheaper than gasoline and EVs require less maintenance. However, a significant con is the limited range and charging time of most electric vehicles, which can be inconvenient for long road trips or those with busy schedules. Additionally, the production of lithium-ion batteries used in many EVs requires large amounts of energy to manufacture, which can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental concerns.",
