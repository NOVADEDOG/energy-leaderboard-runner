  "goal": "Stress energy consumption by requiring chain‑of‑thought reasoning, combinatorial calculations or code generation.",
  "notes_for_experimenter": "These tasks involve multiple reasoning steps or small code snippets. They produce longer answers and encourage the model to maintain internal state, which should increase energy usage as suggested by research linking output length and complexity to energy. When measuring, ensure the model is allowed to think step by step but cap output tokens if necessary.",
